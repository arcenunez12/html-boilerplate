    <!-- To create a link in HTML
    The noopener value prevents the opened link from gaining access to 
    the webpage from which it was opened. 
    The noreferrer value prevents the opened link from knowing which 
    webpage or resource has a link (or ‘reference’) to it. 
    It also includes the noopener behaviour and thus can be used 
    by itself as well.
